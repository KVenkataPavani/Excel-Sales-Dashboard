## Project Overview
This project involved designing a comprehensive sales dashboard in Excel to analyze sales performance across various dimensions, including product categories, regions, sales representatives, and monthly trends. The dashboard enables a clear visualization of sales data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on performance metrics, trend analysis, and key insights.

## Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the [sales_dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PH5Sl91k2qrAqO9NoKlkvBKsdM8YN9ZF/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=110938831569867299215&rtpof=true&sd=true) file, containing detailed information about each sales data given by the company.
